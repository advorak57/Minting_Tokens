# KaseiCoin Token and Crowdsale

This project involves the creation of a new cryptocurrency, KaseiCoin, for the Martian colony. The KaseiCoin is an ERC-20 compliant fungible token that is minted via a crowdsale contract. 

The project is structured into three main parts:

1. **KaseiCoin Token Contract:** This contract defines KaseiCoin as an ERC-20 token.
2. **KaseiCoin Crowdsale Contract:** This contract manages the crowdsale process, allowing users to send Ether to the contract and receive KaseiCoins in return.
3. **KaseiCoin Deployer Contract:** This contract is responsible for deploying the KaseiCoin and KaseiCoinCrowdsale contracts.

The contracts are written in Solidity and are compiled using version 0.5.5 of the compiler. 

## Setup and Deployment

The contracts can be deployed locally using Remix, MetaMask, and Ganache. Detailed steps on setting up the environment and deploying the contracts are provided in the sections above.

## Testing

The functionality of the crowdsale can be tested by using test accounts to buy new tokens and checking the balances of those accounts.

## Screenshots

Screenshots of successful compilation of contracts and interactions on Remix IDE are included in the Images folder.

## Review 

The total supply of minted tokens and the amount of wei raised by the crowdsale contract can be reviewed.

## Note

This project is for educational purposes. Before launching a real crowdsale, please make sure to follow all the relevant legal and security best practices.
